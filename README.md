Studying pH Trends of Water in Maharashtra Using Control Charts

Objective

 Analysing the pH trends of Maharashtra's water resources involves understanding and monitoring the acidity or alkalinity levels in different water bodies within the state.
	To systematically monitor and record the pH levels of selected rivers in Maharashtra over a specified time period.

	To create a control chart to visualize and analyse deviations in pH levels.

Problem statement

The study aims to assess and monitor the pH levels of water in different rivers across Maharashtra using a control chart methodology. The pH of water is a crucial indicator of its quality and can directly impact the health of aquatic ecosystems and human communities dependent on these water bodies. However, consistent, and systematic monitoring is essential to identify potential deviations from normal pH levels.
Challenges
1)	Variability in pH Levels: Maharashtra's rivers may exhibit significant variability in pH levels due to natural and anthropogenic factors. Understanding and addressing this variability is essential for effective water quality management.
2)	Human Health Concerns: Many communities rely on these rivers for drinking water and other domestic uses. Deviations in pH levels could pose risks to human health, emphasizing the need for consistent monitoring and prompt corrective actions.

Control Chart: Control chart is used for graphical representation of quality characteristics which indicates whether the process is under control or out of control. control chart must be investigated to identified in control and out of control process and detect common causes and special causes of out-of-control state.
There are three lines present on control chart.
1)central limit/specification limit -The central line in the control chart can be the calculated mean value of the control values or a reference value for the control sample.
2)Upper control limit/upper specification limit - The Upper Specification Limit (USL) is the maximum allowable value for a measurement or reading that remains acceptable to the customer.
3)Lower control limit/lower specification limit -The lower specification (LCL) is the minimum allowable value for a measurement or reading that remains acceptable to the customer.

Types of control charts 
•	Control charts for variable
1)x-bar chart or Mean chart
2)R chart or Range chart
3)S chart or standard deviation chart

•	Control chart for attribute 
1)p-chart or fraction defective chart
2)np chart or number of defective charts
3)c chart or finitely countable defective chart
In our project, we will utilize a control chart for variables because our dataset consists of continuous measurements. This type of control chart is employed when we need to closely monitor the variability in continuous measurements, such as in our case, where we're examining how the pH of water varies over time and across different regions.
We will not be using a control chart for attributes since it is designed for situations where you are dealing with discrete data, and it is primarily used to monitor the presence or absence of specific conditions or characteristics, which is not the focus of our project.
